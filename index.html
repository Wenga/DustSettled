            <p> Hello, we haven’t met before, but I was hoping to ask you for a small favor.

        <div id="div2" class="message-container hidden">
            <p>It won’t cost you anything or take much effort, I just need your help in making a decision. 
                As a thank you, I’ve already taken care of the bill for this meal.

            <p>By the way, I ordered the drink on the table without alcohol for you. Hope you like it.

        <div id="div4" class="message-container hidden">
            <p>Do you drink at all? I used to, a lot actually. But I quit some time ago.

        <div id="div5" class="message-container hidden">
            <p>I always thought having a couple drinks and losing my cool wasn’t that big of a deal. 
                My son and daughter-in-law weren’t fans, but I figured they were being overly cautious.

        <div id="div6" class="message-container hidden">
            <p>Then something happened, and I finally realized, alcohol can truly be deadly.

            <p>Can you put on those glasses near you? They’ll connect to my memories and share them with you.

            <p>I really hope the way it looked didn't make you uncomfortable.

            <p>I asked the chef to create this dish in a way that represents how I was feeling back then...

            <p>What did you think of the second dish? It was a birthday cake... but it melted pretty quickly, didn’t it?

            <p>That’s kind of how my life has felt these past few years
                —everything looked happy and great on the outside, but deep down, there was this constant sense of unease I just couldn’t get rid of.

        <div id="div17" class="message-container hidden">
            <p>It was like all the happiness could just disappear, like a fragile bubble…

            <p>And then, eventually, I realized that feeling wasn’t for nothing.
